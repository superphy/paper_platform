% 1. brief: WGS is standard
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) can in theory provide the entire genetic content of an organism. This unparalleled resolution and sensitivity has recently transformed public-health surveillance and outbreak response \cite{ronholm2016navigating,lytsy2017time}. Additionally, the identification of novel disease mechanisms \cite{wang2014whole,yuen2015whole}, and rapid clinical diagnoses and reference lab tests based on the specific mechanism of disease are now possible. \cite{willig2015whole,dewey2014clinical}.

% 2. Big Problem: but tools are for individual analysis
The rapid characterization and comparison of bacterial pathogens relies principally on the combination of outputs from multiple software programs that are targeted for specific applications. Examples include the Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) \cite{mcarthur2013comprehensive} for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene prediction, VirulenceFinder \cite{kleinheinz2014applying} virulence gene annotation, and Prokka for bacterial genome annotation with external tools \cite{doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu153}. Comprehensive platforms that combine individual programs into a cohesive whole also exist. These include free platforms such as the Bacterium Analysis Pipeline (BAP) \cite{thomsen2016bacterial}, the Integrated Rapid Infectious Disease Analysis (IRIDA) project \url{http://www.irida.ca/}, and PATRIC. Commercial applications, such as Bionumerics, which is used by PulseNet international for the analyses of WGS data in outbreak situations also exist, and offer support as well as accredited, standardized tests {REF}.

% 3. 100,000 genomes, (lookup number for Enterobase, GenBank), how do we run analysis on it
WGS data for bacterial pathogens of public health importance have recently accumulated in public databases in the tens of thousands, with hundreds of thousands set to be available within the next few years. For \textit{Escherichia coli}, there are over sixty thousand publicly available genomes in EnteroBase \url{https://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/} and X whole genomes in GenBank \cite{doi:10.1093/nar/gks1195}.

To begin to solve this "big-data" problem, platforms such as BAP and IRIDA provide hosted solutions that compute results in real-time, and distribute analyses across computing resources. While effective for self-contained workflows, many of the comparative analyses that are run are broadly useful, and therefore computed multiple times. An effective method to mitigate the recomputing of analyses is to make the storage and retrieval of results part of the platform, and effectively linked to the organisms of interest with a standardized ontology. Such measures can help ensure the rapid response times required for public health applications, and allow results to be integrated and progressively updated as new data become available.

% 1. Our specific problem, previous work
We have previously developed Superphy \cite{whiteside2016superphy}, an online predictive genomics platform targeting \textit{E. coli}. Superphy integrates pre-computed results with domain-specific knowledge to provide real-time exploration of publicly available genomes. While this tool has been useful for the thousands of pre-computed genomes in its database, the current pace of genome sequencing requires real-time predictive genomic analyses of tens-, and soon hundreds-of-thousands of genomes, and the long term storage and referencing of these results, something that the original SuperPhy platform was incapable of.

% 2. Why solving it is important (for Public health / research)
- everything is being sequenced (surveillance / outbreak / research)
- previously mentioned common analyses / want to leverage pre-computed results
- WGS does not discard old methods, linkage to thousands of historical results by developing in-silico methods of traditional tests
- need fast / standardized outbreak response
- need fast / standardized in-silico reference lab
- need fast / standardized storage and retrieval of results based on ontology
- all known data can be leveraged, allows the most informed decisions possible
- etc.

% 3. how we solved it
In this study, we present an update to the SuperPhy platform, called Spfy. The update rewrites the result storage by using a graph database, and takes a modular approach to tool integration, and distributes analyses over task queues; this allows users to submit genomes and modules to run in parallel in real-time.

{needs to be beefed up, in language a biologist / public health worker would care about}

All results are stored as a series of linked nodes which enables the platform to build associations between results as they are generated. \par

% 4. benefits: rapid analyses in real-time -> huge comparisons, replace reference labs -> time & money saved, future work -> expand analyses, more genomes, more species
By integrating task distribution with graph storage, Spfy enables large-scale analyses, such as epidemiological associations between specific genotypes, biomarkers, host, source, and other metadata, and statistical significance testing of genome markers for user-defined groups.
Subtyping options are ..., pan-genome generation ..., group comparisons via Fisher's, ML, .... for E.coli.

By supporting multiple \textit{in-silico} subtyping options, the platform functions similar to a reference laboratory, with added support for big-data analyses.
Currently, the platform has been tested with XXX genome files and result storage for XX analyses modules.

Future work will focus on adding additional analyses modules, using machine learning and artificial neural networks to aid genotype to phenotype predictions, and supporting different species. While the integrated approach or storing and retrieving results provides enormous benefits, the developed analyses modules are self-contained and can easily be integrated into existing platforms such as Galaxy \cite{goecks2010galaxy}, and IRIDA.

% Some general comments
% The NAR Database issue is more of a showcase then a rigorous exploration of software design choices.
% Given this focus, i would suggest the following:
% 1. Increase/highlight the discriptions of the functions and capabilities, maybe by adding a Functionality section
% 2. In the Implmentation (or Methods) section, only give a cursory description of the layout and components. Don't need to provide too much justification
% 3. Use the Results section to highlight the scope/size and speed. This can be short
% 4. In the Discussion, this is where i would expand on the justications and reasons for specific design choices. Pick 2-3 main ones and discuss those (i.e. don't need to justify our choice of documentation software). Also compare with other software in Discussion.
% 5. Add a conclusions section


\section{FUNCTIONALITY}
% ONLY FOCUS ON THE ANALYSIS MODULES
% Describe available functions in spfy
% para covering everything
Spfy performs reference laboratory tasks: O-antigen and H-antigen typing using ectyper \url{https://github.com/phac-nml/ecoli_serotyping}, Shiga-toxin (STX) typing,  virulence factor (VF) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene determination, and related strain determination.

Spfy also performs bioinformatics analyses: pangenome generation, statistical significance testing of genome markers for user-defined groups, and AMR predictions using support vector machines (SVMs).


TODO: List all of the below references in the above paragraphs.
%We introduce one new bioinformatics program, Ecoli-Serotyper (ECTyper) , for determining surface-antigen type and associated VFs, and utilize existing software: the Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) program \cite{mcarthur2013comprehensive}, Phylotyper \cite{whiteside2017phylotyper}, and Panseq \cite{laing2010pan}.

% para covering ectyper & RGI -- don't really need this
% RGI has its own paper and was in the previous SuperPhy paper
% ectyper will get its own paper

\section{IMPLEMENTATION}
% para: the semantic web
Spfy is built around semantic web technologies which describe the relaions between different data \cite{berners2001semantic}. For biological data this means that individual data points such as genome, contiguous DNA sequence, or gene, are linked together in a queryable graph form. This allows novel data to be seamlessly incorporated into the existing graph, and has {TODO: what has been proposed specifically?} been proposed as a common standard for the open sharing of data \cite{horrocks2005semantic}.

% para: semantic web in spfy
In Spfy, the results from all the analysis modules are converted into graph objects, which are used to update the main graph database. TODO: need information about ontology, terms etc. for metadata.

The use of semantic web technologies allows results to be linked to the genomes they were computed from, and for all data points to share a common data structure that can be queried together.

% para: intro to the spfy stack
Spfy's server-side code is developed in Python and the website served to users using the React JavaScript library.

For the addition of new data to the database, the following steps are taken:

i) The upload begins through the ReactJS-based website, where user-defined analyses options are selected. The results of these chosen analyses are immediately reported to the user following their completion, while the remaining analyses are subsequently completed and stored in the database without interaction from the user. The public web service accepts up to 200 MB of genome files (50 genomes uncompressed, or 120 genomes compressed).

ii) User-selected analyses are enqueued into the Redis Queue \url{http://python-rq.org/} task queue. Redis Queue consists of a Redis Database \url{https://redis.io/} and task queue workers which run as Python processes.

iii) The workers dequeue the analyses, run them in parallel, and temporarily store results in the Redis database.

iv) Python functions parse the results and permanently store them in Blazegraph \url{https://www.blazegraph.com/}, the graph database used for Superphy.

The entire Spfy update is packaged as a series of Docker \url{https://www.docker.com/} containers and connected together using Docker Compose \url{https://docs.docker.com/compose/}.

\subsection{Data Storage}
% para
% 0. Goals: big-data, everything linked, easy addition of new links
% 1. spfy is built around graph technologies
% 1. how we structure our graph
% 2. ontoogies used
% 3. inferencing
% 3 1/2. SPARQL queries
Graph databases describe relationships between data points, and are one of the emerging \cite{de2015trends} database types for biological data; they are one of the core building blocks of semantic web technology \cite{horrocks2005semantic}.
Spfy uses the RDFLib Python library \url{https://rdflib.readthedocs.org/} to represent all data, including the results of the analyses modules.

% note: below is a feature in development
The permanent storage of results is as a one-time cost, and allows population-wide analyses of all stored genomes; result storage also enables Spfy to avoid recomputation when the same analysis is re-run.

% para
% ontology
The structure of the graph database is handled using ontologies: indices which define types of data and the relations between them.
By sharing ontologies, it is possible to link databases from different organizations together, and Spfy uses types defined in the  Genomic Epidemiology Application Ontology (GenEpiO) \cite{griffiths2017context} and the Feature Annotation Location Description Ontology (FALDO) \cite{bolleman2016faldo}.
Spfy also connects genomes, contiguous sequences (contigs), pangenome regions, and predicted genes and alleles using generic realtion edges, to allow the presence of various genes to be infered from a genome description.
(see Figure \ref{fig-ontology})
Individual genes and pangenome regions are connected to all the contigs they are found on using this inferencing method, such that it is possible to determine all the genomes which contain a particular target sequence.

The front-end website is written using the React JavaScript library \url{https://facebook.github.io/react/} as a single-page application to allow efficient data-flow without reloading the website.
To ensure a familiar user interface, we followed the Material Design specification \url{https://material.io/}, published by Google, surrounding a card-based design.
(see Figure \ref{fig-results})
Both the task selection and results page follow this card-based design: while data storage is actually graph-based, the results of various analysis modules are presented to users in a familiar tabular structure and available for download as .csv files.
(see Figure \ref{fig-tables})

\subsection{Real-time analysis pipelines}

%	related: packaging of modules in conda

TODO: The below was already covered above. No need to repeat. Either here or there, but combine.
%% Task queues are processes which schedule code exection across available computing infrastructure.
%% In Spfy, the Python-based Redis Queue library \url{https://github.com/nvie/rq} is used to manage analysis tasks and run them asynchronously in response to user requests.
%% When a user submits files for analysis or requests population-wide comparisons, separate tasks are enqueued at different priorities, depending on our user experience goals.
%% For example, population-wide analyses have a higher priority than bulk subtyping analyses, as we want search-response queries to return instantly whereas a delay in subtyping is typical in similar web services, such as the Center for Genomic Epidemiology Pipeline (CGE Pipeline) \cite{thomsen2016bacterial}.
%% Spfy enables processing of thousands of genome sequences by using task queue workers running in parallel, which also allows performance to scale to available infrastructure.
%% In addition, the open-source Sentry toolkit \url{https://github.com/getsentry/sentry} was integrated and used for real-time exception tracking and to ensure reliability of the platform.

% 2. error handling: rq-dashboard, sentry
% 3. why options like sentry are better than traditional logging: scales well to tons (big-data levels) of tasks, groups the same errors together, reporting via email

% para

% 1. how we implemented docker
% 3. how this lets us replicate worker containers and link everything together

TODO: bring the docker information from above down here.
The Spfy platform depends on a series of webservers, databases, and task workers and uses \url{https://www.docker.com/}, a virtualization technology, to run self-contained operating systems on the same host computer.
Software packages are installed within the conatiners and the entire platform is networked together using Docker-Compose \url{https://docs.docker.com/compose/}.
(see Figure \ref{fig-docker})
Docker integration ensures that software dependencies, which typically must be manually installed \cite{doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu153,laing2010pan,inouye2014srst2,naccache2014cloud}, are handled automatically, and that service runtimes are compartmentalized; this guarantees that code failures do not propagate to other services.

\subsection{Continuous integration and testing}
% Keep this short
% para
% 1. goals: why CI, testing is important
% 2. how we've implemented it, integration with github

TravisCI \url{travisci.io}, a continuous integration (CI) platform, is used to ensure that Spfy \url{https://github.com/superphy/backend} does not break with any changes to the codebase, and runs tests for functionality and backwards compatibility.
The individual tests use PyTest \url{https://doc.pytest.org/}, and are run within TravisCI's virtual environment, and the current build status can be checked either on our Gtihub repository or at \url{https://travis-ci.org/superphy/backend}.
CI is also used to automatically build Spfy's core Docker images, and upload them to Docker Hub \url{https://hub.docker.com/u/superphy/}.

\section{RESULTS}
TODO: Update with all of Enterobase
Spfy was tested with 25,185 public \textit{E. coli} genomes, 5,353 genomes from GenBank and 19,832 genomes from Enterobase, and 55,353 generated samples genomes (267GB), storing both the entire sequences and results for all included analysis modules.
The resulting database had XYZ nodes and XYZ edges, with XYZ object properties, which worked out to XYZ GB of data stored.

% analysis run-time / throughput with different levels of parallelization


\section{DISCUSSION}

% drawbacks - big data
Many previous bioinformatics software programs have been developed \textit{ad hoc}, without the use of software engineering principles \cite{de2015trends}.
Such tools were often script-based, with custom data formats, and only suitable for small collections of data \cite{de2015trends}.
While this was acceptable for smaller analyses, bioinformatic pipelines utilizing WGS data are larger and involve linked dependencies, which require the application of systems engineering principles \cite{schatz2015biological}.
Additionally, many subsets of biology now require the analyses of big-data, where the ability to perform computations in real-time, store data in flexible databases, and utilize a common application programming interface (API) linking resources are required \cite{swaminathan2016review}.

One of the key goals in developing Spfy is to maintain instantaneity, as modern websites have accustomed users to instant results.
We attempt to use innovations in web development to bring a similar experience to Spfy as a predictive genomics platform for \textit{E. coli}.
% Mention where users / developers can find documentation
Spfy's main documentation and codebase are provided at \url{https://github.com/superphy/backend} and a developer guide is provided at \url{https://superphy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}.

\subsection{Impact on Public Health Efforts}

% para
% focus on application
The isolation and characterization of bacterial pathogens are critical for Public Health laboratories to rapidly respond to outbreaks, and to effectively monitor known and emerging pathogens through surveillance programs.
Until recently, public-health agencies relied on laboratory tests such as XYZ to characterize bacterial isolates in outbreak and surveillance settings.

TODO: The below has previously been covered by many papers, including our previous SuperPhy paper. We need to focus on the big-data aspect.
%% The previous gold-standard in determining strain relatedness was pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) {ronholm2016navigating}, which uses rare-cutting restriction enzymes to produce a unique banding pattern for each strain.
%% However, in \textit{Enterococcus faecium}, PFGE has been shown to misclassify 9 of 132 isolates, when compared to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) based discrimination \cite{pinholt2015multiple}.
%% In \textit{Klebsiella pneumoniae} \cite{marsh2015genomic}, \textit{Yersinia enterocolitica} \cite{gilpin2014limitations}, and \textit{Staphylococcus aureus} \cite{doi:10.1093/ofid/ofu096}, WGS was used to discriminate isolates after initial clustering by PFGE resulted in indistinguishable samples.
%% Examination of PFGE bands are also subjective, difficult to share \cite{lytsy2017time}, and collative platforms such as PulseNet reported \cite{gilpin2014limitations} that even after collecting 72\% of \textit{Campylobacter jejuni} in a given year in Minnesota (673 c
%% ases), 87\% of isolates could not be linked by PFGE pattern.
Antimicrobial resistance testing, virulence factor testing ...
However, current efforts are focused on predictive genomics, where the relevant phenotypic information can be determined through examination of the whole-genome sequence.
, and as such can be used to evaluate the spread of outbreaks with better resolution and context than traditional methods \cite{ronholm2016navigating}.

% application: results similar to a wet-lab
Spfy uses WGS results.
After intial sequencing of new isolates, Spfy can be used in place of a traditional reference laborartory, to determine the O-type and H-type, Stx type, and all known VFs and AMR genes in real-time.
These results can be shared with other ageencies and researchers over the internet.
Futhermore, using Spfy's database of pre-processed genomes, Spfy can determine all strains a sample may be related to which is useful for ...
Cost benefits ...

\subsection{Comparison with other bioinformatic pipeline technologies}

% namely galaxy
Other scientific workflow technologies such as Galaxy \cite{goecks2010galaxy}, Kepler \cite{ludascher2006scientific}, and Taverna \cite{oinn2004taverna} have been applied to bioinformatic tasks.
Galaxy aims to provide a reproducible compuation-based research environment which is accessible to individuals without programming knowledge.
TODO: BAP and IRIDA, since they were the examples from above
Taverna ...
Kepler ...
To approach the challenge of integrating different bioinformatics programs, Spfy instead uses technologies prevalent in common web services not necessarily related to scientific workflows.
While we prefer to package individual bioinformatics programs using language-agnostic package managers such as Conda \url{https://conda.io/}, we do agree that suites of bioinformatics software benefit from having all dependencies installed and deployable in Docker containers \cite{di2015impact}.
These programs are connected to form a workflow using task queues; a design methodology used to offload long-running or non-instantaneous tasks over available computing infrastructure.
Unlike platforms such as Galaxy which favor a drag-and-drop design for building workflows, Spfy favors a tightly coupled approach explicitedy linking together different bioinformatics programs within the task queue implemntation.
In particular, Spfy uses asynchronous tasks queues which are tripped in response to user requests, thereby allowing immediate responsivity to users on the website, and processes generating human-readable results can be separated from processes handling long-term result storage.

% standard web tech means you can deploy to different cloud computing services
One of the key benefits of using more common-place technologies is the compatibility with other infrastructure resources.
Docker containerization is widely supported by cloud computing services: Amazon Web Services (AWS) \url{https://aws.amazon.com/docker/}, Google Cloud Platform (GCloud) \url{https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/}, and Microsoft Azure \url{https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/}, and self-hosted cloud computing technologies such as OpenStack \url{https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Docker}.
% we may want to sign up for a free trial to give an example of this
Spfy packages compute nodes, which manage a collection of task queue workers, as reproducible Docker containers which can be networked together to form a compute cluster.
Docker containerization has a neglible impact on performance \cite{di2015impact}, and allows the platform to easily scale to demand.
In contrast to Galaxy, Spfy is a targeted approach building a predictive analytics platform for \textit{E. coli} which leverages generic web technologies to favor a responsive, big-data design strategy tackling the challenge \cite{fricke2014bacterial} of integrating results from multiple genomes and examining shared connections.
By packaging the individual bioinformatics software as Conda packages, they can be easily ported to Galaxy.

\subsection{Comparison with similar bioinformatic pipelines}

% para: \cite{naccache2014cloud}
% must install a ton of deps and even create dbs manually https://github.com/chiulab/surpi
% im not actually sure where they're getting the 'cloud-compatible' aspect of their paper from - its cloud compatible in that you deploy in the same manner as you would to bare-metal, but that's just like saying it 'runs on a computer'

% para: \cite{aanensen2016whole}
% makes some pretty pictures, but not really a pipeline

% para: \cite{joensen2014real,thomsen2016bacterial}
% we have a lot of similar directions to this, but just try to make it prettier, more friendly to use, and faster

TODO: The needs to be linked to the previous discussion above, as its absence was conspicuous.
The Bacterial Analysis Platform (BAP), developed out of the Technical University of Denmark, is the closest analogue to Spfy, and provides an integrated analysis pipeline for bacterial WGS data as a web service.
BAP is novel in its combined approach to genome analysis as different programs, such as for VF and AMR determination, are included by default into the pipeline; Spfy provides similar functionallity with an expanded focus on integrated result storage and big-data analyses.
In place of a MySQL database for storing the location of result files, Spfy parses result data into graph objects and integrates results into a persistant graph database.
This enables Spfy to create large datasets where analysis results are linked to genomes, and to perform population-wide analyses.
On a per file basis, Spfy performs at a similar speed to BAP on predictive genomics tasks, though Spfy does not provide genome assembly services.
Spfy also processes XXXX files over XX tasks in XXXX time by using a novel approach of distributing computations over a task queue and multiple Docker compartmentalized containers.
